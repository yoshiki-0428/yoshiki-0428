## work summary

<div style="border: 1px solid; padding: 3px;">
After graduating from university, joined an information and telecommunications development company. As a system engineer, he was in charge of basic program design and development. Consistently engaged in the development of business systems for the logistics industry. In his second company, he worked for a venture company for two years to experience scratch development from scratch. He gained a wide range of experience from planning and design to development work and sometimes as an IT instructor. He worked as a sole proprietor for about 2 years in order to catch up with modern languages quickly, and experienced development work in various languages with advanced microservices architecture.　After that, he joined Rakuten Group, Inc. as a full-time employee because he could not experience "responsible production work" as much as he could with outsourcing contract. Currently, he is in charge of developing a flea market application using Ruby on Rails.

## Self PR

　Web application engineer who can design a wide range of applications from back-end to front-end. We use Go, Java, Vue.js, and TypeScript, and can design applications with a microservices architecture and an understanding of the characteristics of each language. 
　I can implement backend, OAuth2 authentication, DB SQL tuning, BFF construction, and develop in conjunction with the front-end. Also, I have controlled WebFlux in Spring5 and implemented real-time events through PubSubAPI.
　He understands the importance of separating the front-end, the component philosophy of AtomicDesign, and the communication and representation parts of the development process. I was also responsible for advanced technical challenges such as real-time model playback of robot models using Three.js WebGL and SSE (real-time events).
I also have the skills to connect the application layer to the infrastructure layer, such as creating Docker images of each application, and converting simple scripts to CronJobs on k8s.

Recently, I have been interested in team building, and we have been doing YWT review to share the same issues with our current team, user story mapping and use case MTG to avoid missing the features of PJ.

## Interests and Motivatons

- Prefer a development style where the team makes small, quick releases, and then works through a cycle of improvement while receiving user feedback.
- I am good at developing products after conducting user interviews and inception decks in a user-first manner.
- I am relatively good at back-end implementation, but equally capable of front-end implementation. I have no experience in building infrastructure, which I recognize as a weakness.
- Can run CI for some testing and build application-level Docker image builds
- Pair Pro and Mob Pro as a solution for communication in remote work, sharing business logic and transferring skills between teams as much as possible.
